### This file contains a list of paths to ignore changes of. ###
### The paths are relative to the workspace root.            ###
### The paths are separated by newlines.                     ###
### Note that this is not behaving like a .gitignore file,   ###
### and you cannot invert some paths by prefixing them with  ###
### a ! or use wildcards.                                    ###
### Any subfolder of a path is also ignored.                 ###
### Important: No leading or trailing whitespace is allowed  ###
###            on any line.                                  ###
### Changing anything in this file will have no effect until ###
### the language server is restarted.                        ###
### Keep in mind that already analyzed files will not be     ###
### re-analyzed OR removed from the database.                ###
